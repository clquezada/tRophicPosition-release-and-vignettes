# tRophicPosition

This is the release, example and vignettes repository of `tRophicPosition`.

`tRophicPosition` is a colaborative project of [Chris Harrod](http://harrodlab.net), [Andrew L. Jackson](https://github.com/AndrewLJackson), [Claudio Quezada-Romegialli](https://github.com/clquezada) and others. It consists of an R package incorporating a Bayesian model for the calculation of consumer trophic position using stable isotopes with one or two baselines. It uses the powerful approach of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations provided by [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net) and the statistical language [R](https://www.r-project.org).

As of 12th of October 2017, the release version of the package is 0.7.3.
